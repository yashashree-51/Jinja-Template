        <h3>Concluding Remarks:</h3>
        <p>
          Hotspots identified in the above mentioned panels were identified
          using professional Zenmuse HT20 sensors and are only an indication of
          possible defects that might arise due to various reasons namely
          manufacturing inaccuracies, improper maintenance & cleaning, etc.
          These images indicate a difference in temperature when observed using
          a professional grade thermal camera/sensor and give the asset
          owner/plant manager/O&M contractor additional information on
          corrective maintenance. All the defects identified follow IEC
          Standards 62446-3 and have been classified based on methods &
          procedures outlined in them. Corrective actions that have been
          recommended are only indicative of preliminary failures and the
          estimated loss of power due to the defects has been arrived assuming
          that complete failure of the components have already occurred. It
          should be noted that such estimated losses are also dependent on much
          larger macro factors and only if sufficient information is provided a
          nearly exact power loss can be computed. Prolonged inaction on the
          panels might lead to further damage and may result in more critical
          failure which might be beyond repair.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend you to conduct a performance analysis of the asset under
          maintenance to enhance production & efficiency of the plant.
